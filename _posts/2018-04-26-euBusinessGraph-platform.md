The euBusinessGraph Deliverable D3.1 that describes the "Requirements Analysis, Architecture and API Specification for the euBusinessGraph Marketplace" is now available on the euBusinessGraph project website <a href="http://eubusinessgraph.eu/deliverables/">http://eubusinessgraph.eu/deliverables/</a>

The main goal of the euBusinessGraph project is to create the foundations of a European cross-border and cross-lingual business graph through aggregating, linking, and provisioning (open and non-open) high-quality company-related data, thereby demonstrating innovation across sectors where company-related data value chains are relevant. This is achieved by leveraging the power of the emerging technologies such as Data-as-a-Service and Linked Data.

This report describes the initial architecture of the business graph provisioning of the euBusinessGraph Marketplace platform. The platform aims to:
* Integrate, host, and sustain a scalable business graph data marketplace, with capabilities for data cleaning, enrichment, integration, interlinking, publication and hosting;
* Serve as an entry point for company-related data discovery, exploration and analytics; and
* Grow an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and company-related data services.

The focus of this document is on the euBusinessGraph Marketplace platform and provides: 
* An overview of the euBusinessGraph Marketplace platform, the relevant stakeholders of the platform, and their requirements for the capabilities of the platform;
* A preliminary design and architecture of the platform in terms of the core components, and a set of APIs that will guide the development of the platform in the next phase.
