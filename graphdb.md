#### Software license
GraphDB Cloud is proprietary software with freemium business model. Users can create free of charge databases with full functionality. The only limitation is the amount of data that can be indexed by the database. This model will allow potential data providers to evaluate the service and provide small subsets of their data for testing purposes. Then those providers can be converted to paying customers. The accumulation of many small data providers that are using the system free of charge will gradually lead to the creation of a critical mass of data, enabling meaningful searches for data consumers.
