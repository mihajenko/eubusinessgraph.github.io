The main goal of the euBusinessGraph project is to create the foundations of a European cross-border and cross-lingual business graph through aggregating, linking, and provisioning (open and non-open) high-quality company-related data, thereby demonstrating innovation across sectors where company-related data value chains are relevant. This is achieved by leveraging the power of technologies such as Data-as-a-Service and Linked Data. The project will deliver a technology platform, the euBusinessGraph Marketplace.
