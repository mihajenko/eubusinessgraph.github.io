## euBusinessGraph Marketplace and Services

The main goal of the euBusinessGraph project is to create the foundations of a European cross-border and cross-lingual business graph through aggregating, linking, and provisioning (open and non-open) high-quality company-related data, thereby demonstrating innovation across sectors where company-related data value chains are relevant. This is achieved by leveraging the power of technologies such as Data-as-a-Service and Linked Data.
The project will deliver a technology platform, the euBusinessGraph Marketplace, which aims to:

* Integrate, host, and sustain a scalable business graph data marketplace, with capabilities for data cleaning, enrichment, integration, interlinking, publication and hosting; 
* Serve as an entry point for company-related data discovery, exploration and analytics; and 
* Grow an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and company-related data services.
